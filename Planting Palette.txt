Suggested plants for container and planter use in Britain
________________________________________
Introduction: Container Plants and Ecology
Container and planter cultivation offers both aesthetic and ecological value within urban and domestic spaces. By using suitable species—matched to light, moisture, and soil conditions—you can create living structures that enrich biodiversity while providing seasonal colour and form. Containers extend planting opportunities to paved areas, balconies, and courtyards, supporting pollinators, improving air quality, and softening hard landscapes.
Selecting the right plant for the right place is essential. Species chosen for their tolerance of restricted root zones, varying exposures, and limited water availability will thrive, reducing maintenance and resource use. Combining native and non-native plants can create resilient and ecologically diverse displays that remain attractive year-round.

Preamble
This document presents a curated selection of both native and non-native plant species suited to container and planter use across Britain’s temperate maritime climate. It is intended as a reference for gardeners, designers, and community landscapers who wish to combine sustainability with visual appeal. Each entry summarises growth habit, appearance, and ecological value, helping users choose plants that contribute both beauty and biodiversity.

General Guidance
Successful container planting depends upon sound horticultural practice. Use high-quality, peat-free compost and ensure adequate drainage. Combine soil-based media with grit or perlite to improve aeration and stability. Regular watering and feeding sustain growth, while annual top-dressing refreshes fertility.
General Tips:
•	Containers: Choose appropriately sized pots with drainage holes. Terracotta dries quickly; plastic or fibre-glass retains moisture longer. Raise pots slightly off the ground to aid drainage.
•	Compost: Use a peat-free, loam-based mix such as John Innes No. 3. Drought-tolerant herbs prefer freer-draining media.
•	Watering: Containers dry out rapidly. Water frequently in summer, sparingly in winter. Once established, drought-tolerant species require less frequent watering.
•	Feeding: Apply a balanced liquid fertiliser every few weeks during active growth.
•	Location: Position planters to match species’ light requirements. Sheltered spots reduce wind stress and moisture loss.
